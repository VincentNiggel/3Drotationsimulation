# 3Drotationsimulation
These codes are related to the publication: "3-D rotation tracking from 2-D images of spherical colloids with textured surface" by V. Niggel et al., published in Soft Matter in 2023.
Makenewsim.mat allows to create simulated images of the rotated raspberries particle while rotationscanning3D_final.mat is the code used to analyze the result in the paper.
